RFID Based Bus Detection
An RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) based bus detection system is a technology-driven solution designed to streamline and enhance the management of buses in a public transportation system.
It employs RFID tags and readers to efficiently track and monitor buses as they move through various locations, such as bus stops, depots, or terminals.

System Components and Workflow:

    RFID Tags: Each bus is equipped with an RFID tag, which is a small, passive device that contains a unique identification code. This code is used to uniquely identify each bus in the system.

    RFID Readers: RFID readers are strategically placed at key locations within the transportation network, such as bus stops. These readers emit radio-frequency signals to communicate with the RFID tags on the buses.

    Control Center: The control center serves as the central hub of the system, where data from RFID readers is collected, processed, and analyzed.

    Database: A database stores information about each bus, including its unique RFID tag code, route information and schedule.
